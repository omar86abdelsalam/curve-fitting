# 📊 Numerical Methods & Polynomial Interpolation Toolkit

A powerful, interactive Python tool designed to bridge the gap between **Pure Mathematics** and **Data Science**. This toolkit allows users to calculate, expand, and visualize various interpolation and curve-fitting methods.

## 🚀 Overview
As part of my journey from **Data Analysis** to **AI Engineering**, I built this tool to understand the "mathematical engine" that powers many machine learning algorithms. Unlike standard libraries, this script provides the full symbolic expression of the polynomial.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Symbolic Mathematics:** Uses `SymPy` to output the actual expanded polynomial $P(x)$.
* **Multiple Interpolation Methods:**
    * Lagrange Polynomial
    * Newton Forward & Backward Differences
    * Newton Divided Difference (NDD)
    * Neville’s Method (Recursive approach)
    * Taylor Polynomial Expansion
* **Advanced Visualization:** * Interactive plots using `Matplotlib`.
    * Comparison between Interpolation and **Multi-degree Curve Fitting**.
    * **Quadrant Control:** Focus your visualization on specific quadrants (I, II, III, or IV).
* **Interactive UI:** A command-line interface that guides you through data input and analysis.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3
* **Libraries:** * `SymPy` (Symbolic Math)
    * `NumPy` (Numerical Operations)
    * `Matplotlib` (Data Visualization)
